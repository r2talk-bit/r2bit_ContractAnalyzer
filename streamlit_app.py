# Pathlib - Object-oriented way to handle file paths
# TOML - Library for parsing TOML configuration files (used for secrets management)
# PDFPlumber - Library for extracting text and data from PDFs
# BytesIO - Allows working with bytes data as if it were a file
# Custom utility functions for calling AI models (OpenAI, etc.)
# Custom utility functions for formatting prompts to send to AI models

    Follow these steps to analyze your contract:
    
    1. **Upload your contract** - Use the file uploader in the sidebar to select a PDF contract (max 2MB)
    2. **Customize instructions** - Modify the analysis guidelines in the sidebar if needed
    3. **Run the analysis** - Click the "Run Analysis" button to process your document
    4. **Review results** - The AI-generated analysis will appear in the results section below
    5. **Iterate if needed** - You can upload different contracts or modify instructions for new analyses
    
    The analyzer works best with clearly formatted legal documents and provides insights on key terms, obligations, and potential issues.
